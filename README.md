The Memory Project

Inspired by the effects of documentary strategies in theater, film and literature, 
this project aims to collect and share human experiences. Through simple and open questions, 
anonymously (or self-identified) users will be able to send their memories, stories and 
experiences to the site where it will be categorized and available for viewing by fellow 
users. The hope of this project is to bring people together through empathy and sympathy.
